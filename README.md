ðŸš— Waze User Churn Prediction - Data Inspection & Preparation
ðŸ“ˆ Project Overview
This project is part of the Waze User Churn Prediction initiative. The objective of this phase is to inspect, organize, and prepare Waze user activity data for machine learning modeling. The analysis will help the team understand user behaviors that may lead to churn and set the stage for predictive modeling.

The dataset contains synthetic user data representing app usage, driving behaviors, and retention status.
